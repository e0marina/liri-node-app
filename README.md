# liri-node-app

LIRI is Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. LIRI can take the following commands 

   * `concert-this`

   * `spotify-this-song`

   * `movie-this`

   * `do-what-it-says`
   
   concert-this returns data from the Bands in Town Events API, simply type in: node liri.js concert-this and then the name of a band or artist, and voila! The same format follows for the other commands, although, type a movie in for movie-this.
   
   I made this app for UCLA bootcamp.
